# WhyUseStockfish

It is the result of my AI project.

I use Python. I like it.


I used the following:
---
- **Libraries** | pygame, chess
- **Algorithms** | Minimax algorithm, alpha-beta pruning
- **Data** | Piece-Square Tables


I write code after reading the following report. It is so good for me.ðŸ™‚
